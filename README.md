## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

I would like to make a very simple remind app that sends notifications when i need to do something.  It will have a schedule remind feature wiht a text entry for a message and a way to set the time of the remind using some sort of dropdown menu.  I would also like a TableView of all the scheduled reminds and a button to create a new remind.  The notification banner should also display the message set in the remind and a custom app icon would be nice.
